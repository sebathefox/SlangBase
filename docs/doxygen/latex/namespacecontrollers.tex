\subsection{Detailed Description}
No one knows what it\textquotesingle{}s like To be the badman To be the sad man Behind blue eyes And no one knows what it\textquotesingle{}s like To be hated To be faded to telling only lies

But my dreams they aren\textquotesingle{}t as empty As my conscience seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That\textquotesingle{}s never free

No one knows what its like To feel these feelings Like i do And i blame you No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain and woe Can show through

But my dreams they aren\textquotesingle{}t as empty As my conscience seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That\textquotesingle{}s never free

No one knows what it\textquotesingle{}s like To be mistreated, to be defeated Behind blue eyes An no one know how to say That they\textquotesingle{}re sorry and don\textquotesingle{}t worry I\textquotesingle{}m not telling lies

But my dreams they aren\textquotesingle{}t as empty As my conscience seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That\textquotesingle{}s never free

No one knows what its like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes
